# AdvancesR3:

TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project is a learning project of advanced R - how to make more
reproducible research and better collaborations with others

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, docs and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: nmr-omics data
-   `docs/`: learning.qmd
-   `R/`: nmr.omics.R

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancesR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

documentation.
